## Patches: A Color Palette Mobile App

This project represents a palette-generator mobile application that allows users to grab colors from images (by taking a photo using the phone's camera or uploading a photo from the phone's camera album) and to see the closest color codes they can use to represent these colors digitally. This application also generates color palettes from these colors, allowing for quick and easy designs to be created.

This application is targeted towards artists and designers who wish to save palettes that are based on sceneries and visuals they find in their daily lives.

This application was created using Android Studio and uses Java for the backend and XML for the frontend.
